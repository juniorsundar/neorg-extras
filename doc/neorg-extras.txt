  [!warning]
  This is a highly opinionated plugin. I built this for the sole purpose of
  streamlining my workflow. To that end, my implementation is highly opinionated
  and leaves very little room for customisation or personalisation.
  They may not be the right or most optimal way to do things, but it works for
  me. So, use at your own risk.

3. Neorg-Roam                                        *neorg-extras-neorg-roam*

At the moment, this feature relies heavily on the a 3rd-Party Fuzzy Finder
(Telescope <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or Fzf-Lua
<https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>). I have plans to liberate this plugin
from this need, but that is something way down in the future after I have
implemented the required basic features. So, for the moment, users of this
plugin will have to bear with this dependency.

Also note that there are a lot of similarities in this plugin with
`nvim-neorg/neorg-telescope` <https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg-telescope>.
It implements these features much better than I do, and more cleanly that I do.
If you are comfortable using that, then you can install it along side this
plugin and simply skip the Neorg-Roam feature-set.


SET WORKSPACE                          *neorg-extras-neorg-roam-set-workspace*


FUNCTION ~

`Neorg roam select_workspace`


DEFAULT MAPPINGS ~

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mappings   Action
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  <CR>       Sets workspace.

  <C-i>      Sets workspace and opens the index.norg file in the workspace
             if it exists.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

NODES                                          *neorg-extras-neorg-roam-nodes*


RATIONALE ~

Nodes are defined as the individual pages within a workspace. The node name is
defined as the `title` in the page metadata. The node filename is irrelevant
and should only be unique.

True to the `org-roam` or `logseq` mindset. You shouldn’t have to worry about
organising your workspace files, because you won’t be navigating your
file-tree to find them. Relations should be made using linking rather than
sorting.

**Example** If you want to sort your nodes according to projects. Create one
(1) node with the "Projects" title and other nodes with titles corresponding to
your project names and include their links in the "Projects" node. You can go
to your projects by either directly opening that node from your fuzzy finder or
opening "Projects" and opening the corresponding project node from the inserted
link.

You need to agree to this philosophy of managing your work to take full
advantage of this feature.


USE-CASE ~

You want to navigate to a node in your workspace.

You want to insert the node into your cursor location as a link.

The node you want doesn’t exist yet, and you want to create one with the
title currently present in the Telescope search. This will drop the new node
with unique filename into a `roam_base_directory` folder in the workspace root.


FUNCTION ~

`Neorg roam node`


DEFAULT MAPPINGS ~

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mappings   Action
  ---------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  <CR>       Open to selected node.

  <C-i>      Inserts hovering node into cursor location. Node’s title will be
             concealing alias. Eg: {:$/workspace/path/tonode:}[Title].

  <C-n>      Creates new node with title of text in search bar and unique node
             name.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BLOCKS                                        *neorg-extras-neorg-roam-blocks*


RATIONALE ~

Blocks are defined as the headings within a workspace. The block name is
defined as the heading text.

In `logseq`, the block is considered a first-class citizen. In `org-roam` it
could be, as long as you assign a unique ID property to said block. The benefit
of this is that even if the block is changed, any hyperlink to the block will
be unaffected.

This isn’t a particular feature like that in Neorg as of yet. There may be
something like this in the future.


  [!NOTE] TODO find ways to treat blocks as first-class citizens.

USE-CASE ~

You want to navigate to a block in your workspace.

You want to insert the block into your cursor location as a link.


FUNCTION ~

`Neorg roam block`


DEFAULT MAPPINGS ~

  Mappings   Action
  ---------- ----------------------------------------------
  <CR>       Open to selected block.
  <C-i>      Inserts hovering block into cursor location.

BACKLINKS                                  *neorg-extras-neorg-roam-backlinks*


RATIONALE ~

Since we are swearing off the file-tree, we need a way to conveniently navigate
between nodes. The backlinks offer us an insight into the ways we can get to
the current node.

There are two options to view backlinks. Depending on whether to the
configuration `fuzzy_backlinks` is set to `false` or `true`: - `false` -
(default) Opens the backlinks as a vertical-split buffer. - `true` - Opens the
backlinks within the selected fuzzy-finder.

As a buffer, the entries are **folded**. You can unfold then to reveal a
preview from where the backlinks are extracted. This isn’t necessary with the
fuzzy-finder as it can be configured to show an automatic preview.


USE-CASE ~

You want to determine all backlinks to current node, preview them, and navigate
to them.


FUNCTION ~

`Neorg roam backlinks`


DEFAULT MAPPINGS ~

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mappings   Action
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  <CR>       Open to selected backlink location.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAPTURE                                      *neorg-extras-neorg-roam-capture*


RATIONALE ~

Its common to forgot things. Just so you don’t, why not capture it?

Capturing shouldn’t be difficult, it should be accessible from anywhere. And
getting the captured information shouldn’t be difficult either.


USE-CASE ~

There are two primary types of use-cases: 1. Capturing idea/task/content 2.
Capturing annotation

**In case (1)** You are working and suddenly remember a task you need to
accomplish. Simply call `Neorg roam capture todo`. This will open a temporary
buffer where you can capture the task. Once closed, it will append this content
into your daily journal for the day.

**In case (2)** There’s a really cool code snippet that you want to use at a
later time. Simply select the range in "visual" mode and call `'<,'>Neorg roam
capture selection`. Annotate as you wish and close the buffer. It will be
appended into your daily journal for the day.


FUNCTION ~

`Neorg roam capture <anything>`


  [!NOTE] The following functions are templated. The templates are generated in
  "/.capture-templates". `Neorg roam capture todo` `Neorg roam capture note`
  `Neorg roam capture meeting` `Neorg roam capture selection`
  You can add more templates into this directory.

DEFAULT MAPPINGS ~

In the capture buffer.

  Mappings     Action
  ------------ -------------------------------------------
  <C-c><C-c>   Commit captured content to daily journal.
  q            Close capture buffer and delete content.

==============================================================================
4. Neorg-Agenda                                    *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda*

In order to organise your life in plain-text, you need to be able to open up
your backlog of work… right? Neorg devs have a GTD system in their pipeline,
but to create anything great you need to invest a lot of time. I am an
inherently impatient person, so I decided to build something temporary that I
can use in the meantime.


RATIONALE                                *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda-rationale*

I don’t want to deviate excessively and create new grammar to accommodate my
GTD because if, in the future, Neorg gains its own builtin GTD feature, I want
to minimise issues of backwards compatibility. The last thing I want is to go
through all my old files and remove artifacts that will interfere with the new
and definitely superior GTD implementation.


VIEWS                                        *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda-views*

A new buffer that contains all the tasks in your workspace. Note that it will
only consider tasks that are prefixed with a heading tag:

>norg
    * ( ) This task is recoginsed
    
    - ( ) This task is not ... yet
<

So if you are someone who prefers to use a bullet based task listing strategy,
this may not be the plugin for you.


PAGE VIEW ~

This will show all tasks filtered by the provided task states and turn it into
a paginated view.

`Neorg agenda page <task-states>`

You can list out all possible Neorg task states:

- `ambiguous`
- `cancelled`
- `done`
- `hold`
- `pending`
- `important`
- `recurring`
- `undone`

**Examples**

`Neorg agenda page undone pending` <- Will open agenda view with all pending
and undone tasks in current workspace.

Tasks are currently segregated by the nodes they are found in. You can hit
`<CR>` over the node names to navigate to those nodes as they are hyperlinks.

The agenda view can be closed with `q`.


DAY VIEW (TM) ~

This will sort tasks according to a day view. Something similar to `org-agenda`
but with my own flavour.

Note that the method I am using to assign "metadata" to tasks is not the
official way to do things. That is still awaiting an update of the tree-sitter
parser. I don’t know how long that will take. And as someone who wants to
organise their life yesterday, I can’t afford to wait that long. Hence:

`Neorg agenda day`

You will notice that all of your tasks in the workspace are uncategorised. This
is because we haven’t added the property `ranged_verbatim_tag` that is used
in this plugin-plugin (plugin^2?) to define the sorting categories for the
agenda. You can populate the property tag by checking out |neorg-extras-this|.


TAG VIEW ~

You can also sort tasks by tags. This is useful if you want to sort them
according to projects or pertinent categories. Make sure to include tags in the
property metadata under your tasks if you want these to be sorted.

`Neorg agenda tag`


THE PROPERTY METADATA        *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda-the-property-metadata*

>norg
    @data property
    started: YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM
    completed: YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM
    deadline: YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM
    tag: tag1, tag2, ...
    priority: A/B/C ...
    @end
<

There is tree-sitter folding for the `ranged_verbatim_tag` labeled `data`. So
it no longer will take up your visual space.

Of course, this plug(plugin)in(?) makes your life a lot easier by exposing the
following function:

`Neorg update_property_metadata`

This function doesn’t discriminate between task headings or regular headings
(at the moment… I will fix that later).

This function is multi-purpose:

1. It can add the property tag to the current heading if it doesn’t have one
already.
2. It will update the property tag under the current heading if it has one
already


SORTING-OUT MY LIFE

I would suggest that you open your Day View (TM) and start going through your
uncategorised tasks and start assigning them a started and deadline property.
Maybe add a tag? You could also add a property (but I haven’t implemented
support for finer sorting yet).


INTERACTIVE TASK CYCLING  *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda-interactive-task-cycling*

Manually changing task states and updating metadata to reflect that can grow
tedious after a point. Its basically doing the same thing twice. And who wants
to waste time looking at a clock and writing down the time to log their tasks?
Vim is (after all) all about reducing redundancy and wasted time, and so the
command:

`Neorg cycle_task`

Compresses task state update and property metadata update into one. Calling
this function on a heading that is or isn’t a task will initiate the
interactive task cycling process. The general sequencing of task states are as
follows:

>txt
    # Task Transitions
    undone -> cancelled
    undone -> pending -> done
    undone -> pending -> cancelled
    undone -> pending -> hold -> pending -> done
    undone -> pending -> hold -> pending -> cancelled
    
    undone -> ambiguous -> cancelled
    undone -> ambiguous -> pending -> done
    undone -> ambiguous -> pending -> cancelled
    undone -> ambiguous -> pending -> hold -> pending -> done
    undone -> ambiguous -> pending -> hold -> pending -> cancelled
    undone -> important -> cancelled
    undone -> important -> pending -> done
    undone -> important -> pending -> cancelled
    undone -> important -> pending -> hold -> pending -> done
    undone -> important -> pending -> hold -> pending -> cancelled
    
    undone -> recurring -> done
    undone -> recurring -> cancelled
<

Furthermore, the time properties are populated automatically given the
following state changes: - When creating task -> populate deadline - When
leaving undone -> populate started - When entering cancelled or done ->
populate completed

With this command, I hope that users will waste less time manually messing
around with the property metadata, and focus more on getting things done.

- ☒ Sorting by dates, tags, etc.
    - ☒ Sorting by date and priority (default)
    - ☒ Sorting by tags
- ☐ Better UI for property tag population (especially dates and times)
- ☒ Wrapper around task changer to auto-generate property metadata
- ☐ Alternate views (open to discussion)
- ☐ Permalinking for Neorg-Roam
- ☒ Better UI for Backlinks (Telescope/Fuzzy finder is too distracting)


SECONDARY                                       *neorg-extras-to-do-secondary*

- ☐ Generating graphs for organising tasks
