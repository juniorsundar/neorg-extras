  [!warning]
  This is a highly opinionated plugin. I built this for the sole purpose of
  streamlining my workflow. To that end, my implementation is highly opinionated
  and leaves very little room for customisation or personalisation.
  They may not be the right or most optimal way to do things, but it works for
  me. So, use at your own risk.

OTHERS                                      *neorg-extras-installation-others*

I don’t use any other plugin managers. I haven’t tested this with any
others. If anyone happens to test it with `packer`, `rocks.nvim`, etc., please
feel free to create a pull request.

3. Neorg-Roam                                        *neorg-extras-neorg-roam*

At the moment, this feature relies heavily on the a 3rd-Party Fuzzy Finder
(Telescope <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> or Fzf-Lua
<https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>). I have plans to liberate this plugin
from this need, but that is something way down in the future after I have
implemented the required basic features. So, for the moment, users of this
plugin will have to bear with this dependency.

Also note that there are a lot of similarities in this plugin with
`nvim-neorg/neorg-telescope` <https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg-telescope>.
It implements these features much better than I do, and more cleanly that I do.
If you are comfortable using that, then you can install it along side this
plugin and simply skip the Neorg-Roam feature-set.


==============================================================================
4. Neorg-Agenda                                    *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda*

In order to organise your life in plain-text, you need to be able to open up
your backlog of work… right? Neorg devs have a GTD system in their pipeline,
but to create anything great you need to invest a lot of time. I am an
inherently impatient person, so I decided to build something temporary that I
can use in the meantime.


RATIONALE                                *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda-rationale*

I don’t want to deviate excessively and create new grammar to accommodate my
GTD because if, in the future, Neorg gains its own builtin GTD feature, I want
to minimise issues of backwards compatibility. The last thing I want is to go
through all my old files and remove artifacts that will interfere with the new
and definitely superior GTD implementation.


VIEWS                                        *neorg-extras-neorg-agenda-views*

A new buffer that contains all the tasks in your workspace. Note that it will
only consider tasks that are prefixed with a heading tag:

>norg
    * ( ) This task is recoginsed
    
    - ( ) This task is not ... yet
<

So if you are someone who prefers to use a bullet based task listing strategy,
this may not be the plugin for you.

5. To-Do                                                  *neorg-extras-to-do*


PRIMARY                                           *neorg-extras-to-do-primary*

- ☒ Deadline and time based scheduling
- ☒ Sorting by dates, tags, etc.
    - ☒ Sorting by date and priority (default)
    - ☒ Sorting by tags
- ☐ Better UI for property tag population (especially dates and times)
- ☒ Wrapper around task changer to auto-generate property metadata
- ☐ Alternate views (open to discussion)
- ☐ Permalinking for Neorg-Roam
- ☒ Better UI for Backlinks (Telescope/Fuzzy finder is too distracting)


SECONDARY                                       *neorg-extras-to-do-secondary*

- ☐ Generating graphs for organising tasks
- ☐ Kanban?
